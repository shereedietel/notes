- "Write code that is easy to understand and maintain. It's more important than writing code that is optimized for performance or that uses the latest features. Code is read much more often than it is written, so make it readable and easy to follow. Use meaningful variable names, write clear comments, and structure your code in a logical way. This will make it easier for others (and your future self) to work with your code and will save time and effort in the long run."
